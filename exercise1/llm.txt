2. Motivation for using AI
I used AI tools to enhance my productivity and efficiency in completing the task. 
The AI tools provided valuable assistance in generating ideas, solving problems, and suggesting improvements for my work.
However, the AI should only be used as a supplementary resource rather than a primary source of information. 
Furthermore, I ensured that I critically evaluated the AI-generated content and made necessary adjustments to align with my understanding and the task requirements.

3. How AI was used
In this project, I used AI tools to assist in 
- Analysing the requirements and objectives of the task.
- Researching relevant information and examples.
- Learning new concepts and techniques in coding.
- Bug fixing and code optimization.
- Drafting sections of the report.
- Providing suggestions for structuring the information and improving clarity of the report. 
- Grammatical and stylistic revisions to enhance readability of my report.

4. Reflection on AI usage
Using AI tools improved my efficiency and productivity in completing the task.
The AI tools provided valuable insights and suggestions that helped me overcome challenges and enhance the quality of my work.
However, I also encountered some limitations and challenges while using AI tools.
- The AI-generated content was not always accurate or relevant to the task requirements and my given context.
- I had to spend additional time verifying and validating the information provided by the AI.
- Some AI tools had limitations in understanding the context and nuances of the task, leading to generic or irrelevant suggestions.
- For example, I faced a situation where I could not perform "docker compose down". However, AI could not help me solve this issue. I had to search for the solution on Stack Overflow and GitHub.
Overall, I found AI tools to be a useful resource in my work, but I also recognized the importance of critical thinking and human judgment in evaluating and utilizing AI-generated content effectively.
